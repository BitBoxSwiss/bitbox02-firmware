# The script runs all CI builds and checks in a Docker container.
# It accepts two positional arguments:
# 1. A workspace dir, the root of the git repo clone, or "pull" literal.
#    In the latter case, CI container image is pulled from a registry.
# 2. An optional target branch for code style diffs. Defaults to "master" for
#    push commits and overwritten with TRAVIS_BRANCH env var for pull requests
#    when run on Travis CI.
