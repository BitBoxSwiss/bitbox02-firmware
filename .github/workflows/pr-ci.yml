  # Run this job for every commit in the PR except HEAD.
  # This job simulates what github does for the PR HEAD commit but for every other commit in the
  # PR. So for every commit, it creates a merge commit between that commit and the base branch.
  # Then it runs the CI on that merge commit.
  # The only caveat is that this file (pr-ci.yml) is already loaded from the PR HEAD merge commit,
  # and therefore we need to load the `.ci` scripts from the PR HEAD merge commit. The outcome of
  # that is that changes to the CI is not tested per commit. All commits use the final version.
