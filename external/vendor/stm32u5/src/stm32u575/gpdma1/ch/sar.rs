///Field `SA` reader - source address This field is the pointer to the address from which the next data is read. During the channel activity, depending on the source addressing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC), this field is kept fixed or incremented by the data width (GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2\[1:0\]) after each single source data, reflecting the next address from which data is read. During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1\[5:0\] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2\[21:0\] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC and GPDMA_CxTR3.SAO\[12:0\] once/if completed source block transfer, for a channel x with 2D addressing capability (x = 12 to 15). additional block repeat source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.BRSDEC and GPDMA_CxBR2.BRSAO\[15:0\] In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1. Note: A source address must be aligned with the programmed data width of a source single (SA\[2:0\] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2\[1:0\]). Else, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, the additional GPDMA_CxTR3.SAO\[12:0\] is not applied.
