# BitBox02 python API

This repository contains two packages

* u2fhid
* bitbox02

## u2fhid

This is a small package that contains read/write primitives for u2fhid devices such as the
bitbox02.

## bitbox02

In this folder is the Python API for communicating with the BitBox02 device.

The folder `generated` contains files generated by `python-protobuf`. Regenerate with `make`.

## Installation

To install a release from command line, execute the following:

    pip3 install bitbox02

Note that the package lists optional dependencies behind the extras field.
For example, if Ethereum support is required, install the package with:

    pip3 install bitbox02[ethereum]

To install all optional dependencies, use `all` in place of `ethereum`.

## Development environment

You'll want to install the package in editable mode from this directory
using the following:

    pip3 install -e .[all]
